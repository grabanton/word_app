# Application for Learning English with Ollama

This is a simple CLI app for learning English words like a game. The LLM makes clues, and you need to guess what the word or phrase is behind that clue. You can ask for additional hints and control the current stats. Also, it has some additional modes.

I don't have plans to support this app for everyone's usage. But I think it can be a useful starting point for your own fun English learning app.
